Learning Journey

Hi! 👋 I’m Allan, a junior developer learning my way through web dev & programming.
This repo is my sandbox — a collection of practice projects, experiments, and mini-apps I’ve built while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, and Django.

🧭 Why this repo?

To track my progress as I grow as a developer

To practice real coding (not just tutorials)

To have a space where I can break things & learn from them

To share my journey with other devs

📂 What’s inside
learning/
├── Html/ week 1         # beginner HTML practice
├── Js/                  # JavaScript projects
├── Python/              # small Python scripts

🚀 How to Run

For HTML / JS: just open the index.html file in your browser

For Python: run the file with python filename.py

For React / Django: follow the project’s README inside that folder (or check comments in the code if no README yet)

🛠️ Tech I’m Learning

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Backend: Python, Django

Other: Git/GitHub, npm, virtual environments

🌟 Projects I’m proud of (so far)

Sales Synergy → a sales management & analytics app (still in progress)

POS Web App → learning how frontend & backend connect

Quick_coin → experimenting with coins/finance logic

Lots of small practice projects in HTML, JS, and Python

🎯 Next Steps

Keep practicing React & Django

Learn how to deploy apps

Write better documentation for each project
